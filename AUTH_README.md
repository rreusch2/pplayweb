## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Visit the app
open http://localhost:3000

# Test sign in (should work without clearing browser data!)
# Refresh the page (should stay signed in!)
# Visit http://localhost:3000/auth-debug for diagnostics
```

## 🛠️ Debug Tools

### During Development

**Access via Navigation:**
- Click your user icon (top right)
- Click "Auth Debug" (yellow text, development only)

**Or visit directly:**
- http://localhost:3000/auth-debug

**Console logs:**
- Filter by `[Auth]` to see all auth operations
- Automatic logging in development mode

## 🧪 Quick Test

```bash
# 1. Clear browser data (one last time!)
# 2. Sign in
# 3. Refresh page (F5)
# Expected: Stays logged in, loads immediately ✅

# 4. Visit /auth-debug
# Expected: Green checkmarks for storage & session ✅

# 5. Sign out and try to access /dashboard
# Expected: Redirects to home (middleware protection) ✅
```

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

1. **Visit** http://localhost:3000/auth-debug
2. **Click** "Run Diagnostics"
3. **Check** for red errors
4. **Click** "Clear Auth & Recover" if needed
5. **Export** report if you need to share with team

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

```typescript
// Check if storage is working
import { isStorageAvailable } from '@/lib/supabase'
console.log('Storage OK:', isStorageAvailable())

// Run diagnostics programmatically
import { runAuthDiagnostics } from '@/lib/authDebug'
const diag = await runAuthDiagnostics()
console.log(diag)

// Clear auth storage manually
import { clearAuthStorage } from '@/lib/supabase'
clearAuthStorage()

// View auth state
import { logAuthState } from '@/lib/authDebug'
await logAuthState()
```

## 🎯 What to Monitor

After deploying, watch for:
- Time to auth initialization (should be < 2s)
- Failed sign-in rate
- localStorage errors
- Timeout occurrences

Filter console by `[Auth]` to see everything.

---

## 📞 Help

**Read first:**
1. `AUTH_OVERHAUL_SUMMARY.md` - The full story
2. Console logs (filter by `[Auth]`)
3. `/auth-debug` page diagnostics

**Still stuck?**
- Export diagnostic report from `/auth-debug`
- Check if you're in private browsing mode
- Verify environment variables are set

---

## 🎉 Bottom Line

**You should NEVER have to manually clear browser data again!**

The auth system now works like major platforms (Vercel, Stripe, GitHub) with:
- ✅ Reliable sign-in
- ✅ Session persistence
- ✅ Automatic recovery
- ✅ Self-service debugging
- ✅ Server-side protection
