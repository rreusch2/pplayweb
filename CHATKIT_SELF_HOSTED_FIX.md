# 🔧 ChatKit Self-Hosted Fix

## The Problem

ChatKit was trying to verify with OpenAI's hosted service:
```
POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chatkit/domain_keys/verify_hosted 401 (Unauthorized)
```

This happened because:
1. ❌ Loading ChatKit script from OpenAI CDN (`cdn.platform.openai.com/deployments/chatkit/chatkit.js`)
2. ❌ ChatKit thought it was in "hosted mode" and tried to verify domain keys

## The Solution

**Removed the external script loading!**

### Before:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Load ChatKit script from OpenAI CDN
  const script = document.createElement('script')
  script.src = 'https://cdn.platform.openai.com/deployments/chatkit/chatkit.js'
  document.head.appendChild(script)
}, [])
```

### After:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // For self-hosted ChatKit, we don't need external script
  // The @openai/chatkit-react package handles everything
  console.log('🐍 Using self-hosted ChatKit')
  setIsLoading(false)
}, [])
```

## Why This Works

### With OpenAI Hosted:
- Need to load ChatKit from CDN
- ChatKit verifies domain keys with OpenAI
- Limited to Agent Builder features

### With Self-Hosted:
- `@openai/chatkit-react` npm package handles everything
- Connects directly to YOUR Python server
- No domain verification needed
- Full control over features

## Deploy & Test

```powershell
git add components/professor-lock/ChatKitProfessorLock.tsx CHATKIT_SELF_HOSTED_FIX.md
git commit -m "Fix: remove CDN script for self-hosted ChatKit"
git push
```

After deploy, you should see:
- ✅ `🐍 Using self-hosted ChatKit` in console
- ✅ No more 401 errors to api.openai.com
- ✅ Requests going to pykit-production.up.railway.app/chatkit
- ✅ ChatKit UI stays visible and works!

## The Full Flow Now

```
User opens chat
    ↓
ChatKit React component initializes
    ↓
Gets client secret (user_<id>_<timestamp>)
    ↓
Connects to https://pykit-production.up.railway.app/chatkit
    ↓
Your Python server receives request with:
  - X-User-Id header
  - X-User-Tier header
    ↓
Professor Lock agent processes message
    ↓
Widgets auto-inject as agent runs tools
    ↓
Response streams back to UI
```

No OpenAI verification needed! 🎉
