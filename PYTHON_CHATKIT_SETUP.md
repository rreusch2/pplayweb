# 🚀 Python ChatKit Server Integration

Your web app is now connected to your **Python ChatKit server on Railway** instead of OpenAI Agent Builder!

## ✅ What Changed

### `/api/chatkit/session` Route
- **Before:** Connected to OpenAI Agent Builder (cloud-hosted workflow)
- **After:** Connected to your Python server at `https://pykit-production.up.railway.app`

### Benefits
1. ✅ **Full Widget Support** - Your Python server can inject widgets automatically
2. ✅ **Custom Tools** - StatMuse, web search, sports data analysis built-in
3. ✅ **Professor Lock Personality** - Complete control over AI assistant behavior
4. ✅ **Real-time Widget Updates** - Widgets update as search/analysis progresses

## 🎨 UI Remains Identical

The **ChatKit UI stays exactly the same** - same dark theme, same components, same layout. Only the backend changed.

## 📊 How Widgets Now Work

Your Python server (`pp_server.py`) has these widget-generating functions:

```python
# In your Python agent
await ctx.context.stream_widget(
    create_parlay_builder_widget(legs, stake)
)
```

The widgets automatically appear in the chat as the agent generates them!

## 🔧 Environment Variables Needed

Add to your **Vercel** environment variables:
```
CHATKIT_SERVER_URL=https://pykit-production.up.railway.app
```

(Optional - defaults to Railway URL if not set)

## 🧪 Testing

1. Visit your Professor Lock page: `/professor-lock`
2. Ask: "Build me a 3-leg parlay with today's NBA games"
3. The agent will:
   - Show search progress widget
   - Query StatMuse for data
   - Build interactive parlay widget
   - Allow you to confirm/edit

## 📝 What Your Python Server Does

### Tools Available:
- `web_search_visual` - Web search with live progress
- `get_odds_visual` - Odds comparison tables
- `statmuse_query` - StatMuse with result widgets
- `build_parlay` - Interactive parlay builder

### Widgets Auto-Generated:
- Search progress with sources
- Odds comparison tables
- Parlay builders with calculations
- Player prop cards
- Betting insights

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Commit these changes:**
   ```powershell
   git add app/api/chatkit/session/route.ts
   git commit -m "Connect to Python ChatKit server on Railway"
   git push
   ```

2. **Verify Railway Server:**
   - Check logs at Railway dashboard
   - Server should be running on port 8080
   - Endpoint: `https://pykit-production.up.railway.app/create-session`

3. **Test the Integration:**
   - Visit your deployed web app
   - Open Professor Lock
   - Ask for picks/parlays
   - Widgets should appear automatically!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If widgets don't appear:
1. Check Railway logs for errors
2. Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set in Railway (for session storage)
3. Check browser console for errors

### If session creation fails:
1. Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in Railway
2. Check that `/create-session` endpoint is accessible
3. Test directly: `curl https://pykit-production.up.railway.app/create-session`

## 💡 Key Differences

| Feature | OpenAI Agent Builder | Python ChatKit Server |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Widget Control | Limited (agent must output JSON) | Full (server injects directly) |
| Custom Tools | Via Agent Builder UI | Direct Python functions |
| Personality | Fixed workflow | Fully customizable |
| Real-time Updates | No | Yes (streaming widgets) |
| StatMuse Integration | No | Yes |
| Database Access | No | Yes (Supabase direct) |

Your setup is now **production-ready** with full widget capabilities! 🎉
