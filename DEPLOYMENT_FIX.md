# üöÄ Vercel Deployment Fix

## ‚úÖ Fixed React Peer Dependency Issues

I've updated your `package.json` to resolve the React version conflicts that were causing warnings in your Vercel deployment.

### Changes Made:
1. **Added React overrides** to force all dependencies to use React 19.1.1
2. **Updated environment validation** to include `XAI_API_KEY`

## üîß Environment Variables Setup

To complete the deployment, you need to add the `XAI_API_KEY` to your Vercel dashboard:

### In Vercel Dashboard:
1. Go to your project settings
2. Navigate to **Environment Variables**
3. Add: `XAI_API_KEY` = `your_xai_grok_api_key_here`
4. Apply to **Production**, **Preview**, and **Development**

### Required Environment Variables:
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
XAI_API_KEY=xai-...
```

## üèóÔ∏è Deploy Again

After adding the environment variable:
1. **Redeploy** your project in Vercel
2. The React warnings should be resolved
3. Professor Lock AI will be fully functional

## ‚ö° Quick Test

Once deployed, test the new Professor Lock by:
1. Opening your web app
2. Clicking the brain icon in navigation
3. Trying a quick action like "Today's Top Picks"

The peer dependency warnings were just compatibility notices and shouldn't break functionality, but the overrides will clean them up for a cleaner build process.
