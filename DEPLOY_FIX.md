# ✅ VERCEL DEPLOYMENT - FIXED!

## What Was Wrong
Canvas package requires native dependencies → Vercel build fails ❌

## What's Fixed
Replaced with @vercel/og → Vercel-optimized image generation ✅

## Deploy Now

```powershell
# 1. Commit the fix
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Replace canvas with @vercel/og for Vercel deployment"
git push

# 2. Vercel auto-deploys
# Watch: https://vercel.com/dashboard

# 3. Test after deployment
# Visit: your-app.vercel.app/professor-lock
# Say: "Create a cheat sheet for tonight's games"
```

## What Changed

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `canvas` package | `@vercel/og` |
| `/api/chatkit/render-cheat-sheet` | `/api/chatkit/render-cheat-sheet-og` |

4. **Watch it spread** 🚀
